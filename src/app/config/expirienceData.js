      "Since I started my studies at CETAV, in the year 2022, I began to acquire experience in web design and development, starting with the basics, until concretizing with concepts, practices, technologies and more complex projects. Most of my frontend experience, I have acquired in my years of study. Thanks to the fact that the CETAV training is mostly practical, I have the valuable experience of 2 years developing and realizing UI/UX designs.",
