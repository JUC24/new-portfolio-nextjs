      "As part of the graduation requirements, I had to work on a project as real as possible. The project I was working on during the last semester of my training, was the redesign of the website of the educational center CETAV. In this project I put all the knowledge acquired during the two years of training, both in design and development. This project was built on the Next js framework, so React js was used, Chakra UI was used as ui library, and Airtable was used as database.",
