          I am a web developer and designer, and network technician, lover of
          dogs, technology, art, music, sports and everything related to the
          audiovisual.

          In web development and design, I found the way to combine several of
          my great passions, technology, art and even audiovisual, for example.
          Everything working together to create incredible, eye-catching,
          magical and immersive experiences, both for me and for the end users,
          and there is nothing that fills me with more passion and excitement
          than being part of that process. In addition to this, another thing
          that captivated me about this world was being able to create
          practically anything, code, while a bit frustrating and demotivating
          at times, is also one of the most unconstrained things there is,
          through code you can really improve the world.

          Software developers are more like artists than cold mathematical
          minds. We create artifacts out of nothing that have to evolve and be
          maintained for a long time. Rafael Gomez Blanes
